/*
As you saw previously with the `svg` element, when D3 adds elements to the DOM,
you can target them with CSS rules just like any other element on the page.

Some styles in the map will dynamically change depending on how the user interacts
with the elements - those rules will stay in the script. One style that'll remain
static in our map is the color of the outline around each country. (Note that you
could put this rule in the script, it depends how you want to organize your code.)

For a `path` element, you color the outline with the `stroke` property. Add a CSS
rule that targets all elements with the class `countries`, and give them a `stroke`
color of white (`#fff`).
