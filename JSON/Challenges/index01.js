/*
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a format that's used to structure data.

Because JSON is lightweight, human readable, and easily parsed by machines, it's a popular structure to exchange data over the web.

It started as a JavaScript standard, but now it is language independent and can be used in many programming languages.

JSON is built using two structures:
1. Objects: unordered collections of key-value pairs, surrounded by `{ }`
2. Arrays: ordered collections of values, surrounded by `[ ]`

Declare a new variable using the `let` keyword and name it `myTeam`, then set it equal to an empty object.
