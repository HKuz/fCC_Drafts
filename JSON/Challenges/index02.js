/*
The last challenge mentioned that you structure your data in JSON with objects and arrays.
Both of those structures contain values, which can be:
- Numbers
- Boolean values (`true` or `false`)
- Strings (must use double quotes)
- Objects
- Arrays
- null

Note that the JSON specification requires you to surround any string with double quotes (`" "`), not single quotes (`' '`)! This applies to strings used as keys or values.

We're going to build a structure in JSON to hold the 1986 World Cup champion team from Argentina.

Start by adding a new key into your `myTeam` object called `Team` with a string value of `Argentina`.
