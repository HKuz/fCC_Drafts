# freeCodeCamp Contributions

This repository holds first drafts of [Guide](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/) articles as well as [curriculum expansion](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion) introductions, lessons, and projects that I've contributed to the [freeCodeCamp platform](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

The state of the work here represents how I submitted it in any initial Pull Request before it was merged into the code base. The current status (including any PR comments, community improvements, and revisions) reside in [fCC's GitHub account](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp).


For the 2016 curriculum expansion, I created \~50 lessons and test suites for the Applied Accessibility, Debugging, and various other sections. I also performed QA on an additional \~280 challenges to conform language, create or check tests, and write a section introduction explaining the technology in plain English.

The 2019 curriculum expansion (ongoing) aims to break down a coding project line-by-line to teach the given concept. I created the projects and lessons for the JSON and D3 Map of the World sections.
