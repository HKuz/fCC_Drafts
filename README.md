# freeCodeCamp Contributions

This repository holds first drafts of [Guide](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/) articles as well as curriculum expansion introductions, lessons, and projects that I've contributed to the [freeCodeCamp platform](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp). The state of the work here represents how it was submitted in any initial Pull Request before being merged into the code base.
