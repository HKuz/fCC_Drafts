# JSON Challenges

## Concepts to teach

- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a text file format to structure data
- Popular structure to exchange data over the web because: lightweight, easily exchanged, human readable, easily parsed by machines
- Started as a JavaScript standard, but it's language independent and can be used in many programming languages
- JSON uses two structures:
    1. **Objects:** an unordered collection of name-value pairs
    2. **Arrays:** an ordered collection of values
- Values can be:
    - Numbers
    - Boolean values
    - Strings (must use double quotes)
    - Objects
    - Arrays
    - null
- How to access data in JSON format
    - Dot notation (objects only, uses name but it can't have spaces)
    - Bracket notation (arrays use index, object uses name)
