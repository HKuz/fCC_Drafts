# Learn the basics of Color Theory

## Description:


Colors have several characteristics that can be accessed and changed with CSS properties. These are:

**Hue**: hue is what people generally think of as 'color'. If you picture the spectrum of colors starting with red on the left, green in the middle, through blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line. Does it have more of a red hue, or a blue hue?
**Saturation**: saturation is the amount of gray in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray in it, where a minimally saturated color is almost completely gray
**Brightness**: brightness (sometimes called 'value') is the amount of black in a color. Full brightness of a color has no black, minimum brightness is almost black.
[Do we want to cover opacity here?]

As you've seen in previous challenges, you can specify the color you want to use in a CSS rule by its RGB values, its hex code, or its color name.
