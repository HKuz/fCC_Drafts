- [x] What is Functional Programming
- [x] Separation of Concern

- Imperative hazards:
    - [X] Some showcasing of imperative bugs => Imperative Hazards
- Declarative beauty
    - [X] Intro to non-mutating discipline => It's not the same
    - [X] Declare your dependencies => Show me what you got
    - [X] Some pure Array manipulation => Brave new world
- Mapping
    - [X] Introduction to `Array.prototype.map()` => Less Talk, More Action: Map
    - [X] Closer look at `map()` => I Wanna Map It Map It
- [x] Functional filtering => Less Talk, More Action: Filter
- [x] Filtering 2 - Move to Reduce section???
- Slicing
    - [x] Introduce `Array.prototype.slice()` => Slice the array
    - [x] Rewrite code which has `splice()` over `slice()` => Splice is not functional
- Con-catting
    - [x] Introduce `Array.prototype.concat()` => Concatenation
    - [x] Replace `push()` with `concat()` => .push is not the functional way
- Reduce
    - [x] Introduce `Array.prototype.reduce()` => Less Talk, More Action: Reduce
    - [ ] Teach them how to think of problem solution using `reduce()`
    - [ ] Implement `map()`, `filter()` etc. with `reduce()`
- Sort Arrays with `Array.prototype.sort()`
    - [x] Example using sort => Alphabetical sort
    - [x] Have the camper write a non-mutating version of `sort()` => Non-mutating sort
- String problems in the form of Array processing
    - [x] Split Strings with .split => Split the Sentence
    - [x] Join Strings with .join => Sentensify the array
    - [x] Some sample String processing problem where previously learned lessons are used. (Use Moar reduce (URL slugs) challenge?)
- Check Positive
    - [x] Strictly Positive (Every method)
    - [x] Lenient Positive (Some method)
- [x] Intro to partial and currying
