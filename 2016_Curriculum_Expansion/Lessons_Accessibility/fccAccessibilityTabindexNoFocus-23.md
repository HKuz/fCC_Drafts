# Use tabindex to remove keyboard focus from an element

## Challenge Description

The final function of the `tabindex` attribute makes an element focusable, but removes it from the tab order. To do this, the `tabindex` value is set to a negative number (often -1). While the item can no longer be reached by keyboard navigation, it is still focusable in other ways, such as being styled with the CSS pseudo-class `:focus`.

Here's an example:
`<a href="#" tabindex="-1">No keyboard access for you!</a>`

Note:
A common use of `tabindex="-1"` is to make an element focusable when needed (with the use of a script).  while keeping it out of the tab order, such as pop-up content. However, accessibility of JavaScript functionality is beyond the scope of these challenges.
