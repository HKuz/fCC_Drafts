# Sass Challenges Introduction

Sass, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS. It adds features that aren't available when you use basic CSS syntax. Sass makes it easier for developers to simplify and maintain the stylesheets for their projects.

Sass can extend the CSS language because it is a preprocessor. It takes code written using Sass syntax, and converts it into basic CSS. This allows you to create variables, nest CSS rules into others, and import other CSS files, among other things. The result is more compact, easier to read code.

This section will introduce the basic features of Sass.
