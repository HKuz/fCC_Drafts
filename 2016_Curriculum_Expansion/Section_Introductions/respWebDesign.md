# Responsive Web Design Challenges Introduction

Today, there's a wide range of devices that can access the web. They range from large desktop computers to small mobile phones. These devices have different screen sizes, resolutions, and processing power.

Responsive Web Design is an approach to designing web content that responds to the constraints of different devices. The page structure and CSS rules should be flexible to accommodate these differences.

In general, you should design your web page's CSS to your target audience. If you expect most of your traffic to be from mobile users, take a 'mobile-first' approach. Then, you can add conditional rules for larger screen sizes. If your visitors are desktop users, then design the page for larger screens and add conditional rules for smaller sizes.

CSS gives you the tools to write different style rules, then apply them depending on the device. This section covers the basic ways to use CSS for Responsive Web Design.
